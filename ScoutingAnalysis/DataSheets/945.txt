All auto comments:
	Qualification Match #1: Tried to put cube in switch but hit robot that started on right and didn’t put it into the switch
	Qualification Match #18: Tried to put into switch but too far out 
	Qualification Match #30: Missed switch
	Qualification Match #47: They ejected a cube over the field barrier. It seems like they had run the program for if they were going to start on the other side of the field.

--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #1: Loss, 127 - 402, 2 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Have difficulty collecting and releasing cubes. Their climb is really slow and prevent other bots from getting onto the platform. They have mechanism drive but aren’t very fast at getting around
Qualification #18: Loss, 199 - 373, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 1 Scale, 3 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: This was rough. It can’t pick cubes up off of the ground and keep them. It has a hard time getting them into the switch. Slow slow messy driving. 
Qualification #26: Win, 364 - 288, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: Terrible collector. Spent ages to get a cube just to drop it. Weird lift made it difficult to put cubes in switch
Qualification #30: Win, 427 - 191, 0 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 2 Failed, platform
	Comments: They babe a hard time collecting and retaining. They caused a switch plate to fall off. 
Qualification #42: Win, 398 - 351, 0 EZ, 2 Switch, 2 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Very slow
Qualification #47: Win, 263 - 254, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 3 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Their lift is a diagonal. Probably for stability but it means that their collector and release comes closer to the center of the robot the higher it goes and they don’t have wheels. Thus they can’t eject the cube further out from the robot so it has trouble dropping a cube far out enough from its own chassis to get it into the switch. THey would have to drive into the switch and release to get the velocity required. Also they have a hard time collecting cubes.
Qualification #55: Win, 287 - 224, 3 EZ, 1 Switch, 1 Scale, 0 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: Gets stuck climbing. Can’t go past a certain height. Same issues with lift as last time. Except now they are a EZ runner and the driving isn’t great and there are collector issues but better now. 
Qualification #63: Loss, 184 - 491, 0 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 4 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Helped a teammate stuck on the scale. Collectors hold the cubes too high so they fall or don’t quite reach the switch. 
Elimination #77: Loss, 252 - 401, 0 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 3 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Really bad at getting cubes and can’t scale.
