--------------- General Comments ---------------
Match #6: Collectors were very poor. Very good at EZ thought. 
Match #11: Seemed to be stuck or disabled the entire teleop and endgame 
Match #37: Had a hard time grabbing cubes and moving quickly. 
Match #48: Agonizingly slow driving. Okay-ish collector. Terrible at driving and lining up. 
Match #57: Caused many penalties touching scale in end game. Climbing mechanism is very precarious. Has a helper bar but it did not climb itself this match and no one else climbed with it. Itâ€™s takes it a long time to get cubes into EZ
