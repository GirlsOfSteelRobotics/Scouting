--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #6: Collectors were very poor. Very good at EZ thought. 
Qualification Match #11: Seemed to be stuck or disabled the entire teleop and endgame 
Qualification Match #37: Had a hard time grabbing cubes and moving quickly. 
Qualification Match #48: Agonizingly slow driving. Okay-ish collector. Terrible at driving and lining up. 
Qualification Match #57: Caused many penalties touching scale in end game. Climbing mechanism is very precarious. Has a helper bar but it did not climb itself this match and no one else climbed with it. It’s takes it a long time to get cubes into EZ
Qualification Match #70: Collector was ok
Qualification Match #76: Did not even try end game soooo
Qualification Match #83: Collector didn’t look very sturdy. The robot seemed to get in the way of the others on the alliance more than anything productive.
