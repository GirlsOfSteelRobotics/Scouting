--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #3: Slow to pick cubes off of the stack. Struggled to get cube into the EZ exchange. They were dropping cubes into the EZ the entire time and only got 4
Qualification Match #15: Slow tippy robot. Overall mediocre performance. 
Qualification Match #27: One robot on their alliance was disabled. Has difficulty putting cubes onto scale if there are many cubes on it already. Lift does not extend high enough. 
Qualification Match #39: Very good at EZ extremely fast. Very efficient climb
Qualification Match #59: very very slow super slow
