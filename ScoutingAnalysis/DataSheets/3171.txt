--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #3: Win, 375 - 218, 3 EZ, 1 Switch, 2 Scale, 1 Failed, platform
	Comments: Stable; very weak and EXTREMELY shaky claw (hard time grabbing and ripping cubes) ; pretty good at EZ
Qualification #10: Win, 438 - 185, 0 EZ, 2 Switch, 4 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Very efficient but slow with second scale layer
Qualification #18: Win, 373 - 199, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 5 Scale, 3 Failed, climbed
Qualification #27: Win, 397 - 172, 0 EZ, 2 Switch, 2 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Robot froze a couple of times. Unclear as to why. It’s a bit tippy and the defense played against it was very effective at limiting its abilities. Efficient scale robot when it’s moving. 
Qualification #38: Win, 585 - 165, 8 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: This alliance was stacked. Had one robot from other alliance defending it the entire time but it still did really well running cubes. 
Qualification #50: Win, 362 - 151, 0 EZ, 4 Switch, 2 Scale, 2 Failed, platform
	Comments: Hard time picking up cubes 
Qualification #55: Loss, 89 - 373, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 3 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Rough. A hook that they use to climb with fell off and was dragging behind them and then got tangled in their chassis. Their lift doesn’t seem to be quite talll enough either when the scale is at its highest and the cube has shifted down in the collector. 
Qualification #64: Win, 330 - 233, 2 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Maybe could have gotten more in the ez but they were defended for a while
Qualification #46: Win, 353 - 303, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 5 Scale, 1 Failed, climbed
Elimination #2: Win, 382 - 340, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 3 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Hit scale twice
Elimination #6: Loss, 373 - 318, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 3 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
Elimination #9: Loss, 312 - 415, 0 EZ, 4 Switch, 3 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
