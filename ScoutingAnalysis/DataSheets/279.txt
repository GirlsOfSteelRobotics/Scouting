--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #1: team missed scale twice
Qualification Match #18: Slow. Kept picking up cubes to put on scale but either missed or dropped cube. 
Qualification Match #31: Robot wasn’t super efficient but did well. 
Qualification Match #39: Sometimes had trouble collecting cubes but once in possession had a good lift
Qualification Match #45: Dropped multiple cubes on the lift. 
Qualification Match #60: Collector motor fell off
Qualification Match #78: robot tipped
Elimination Match #4: Motor broke off during match but they continued to push cubes into ez. That’s what they were doing anyway just putting cubes into ez.
Elimination Match #8: Had a very loosey goosey grip on cubes when lifted and mainly went for scale
