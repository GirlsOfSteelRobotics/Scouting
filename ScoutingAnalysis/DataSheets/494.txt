Qualification #62: 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 5 Scale, 3 Failed, climbed
	Auto: Start Pos = Middle, Baseline?: Yes, Right Switch(x1), Left Scale(x0)
Qualification #69: 0 EZ, 3 Switch, 3 Scale, 1 Failed, platform
	Auto: Start Pos = Right, Baseline?: Yes, Left Switch(x0), Left Scale(x0)
	Comments: It looked like a wire or something got yanked off by another robot so they switched from scale to switch
Qualification #82: 1 EZ, 0 Switch, 3 Scale, 2 Failed, climbed
	Auto: Start Pos = Left, Baseline?: Yes, Right Switch(x0), Right Scale(x0)
Qualification #91: 0 EZ, 3 Switch, 1 Scale, 1 Failed, climbed
	Auto: Start Pos = Right, Baseline?: Yes, Right Switch(x1), Left Scale(x0)
	Comments: At the beginning of teleop the robot was smashed several times into the wall near its portal and seemed to go slower after that. I think something was damaged because it just kinda moseyed around in a circle for few seconds. For their drive team there was no groach. Student girl coach instead 
Qualification #112: 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 4 Scale, 3 Failed, climbed
	Auto: Start Pos = Right, Baseline?: Yes, Left Switch(x0), Right Scale(x1)
	Comments: Fast robot. Not very accurate scale placement.
