	Elimination Match #3: Switched side. Kind of jerky movements. 
	Elimination Match #7: Very good start

--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #4: Loss, 191 - 385, 9 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, lifted others
	Comments: Better than yesterday but still slow and haphazard. Not a super efficient robot but could be EZ runner if we don’t have many options.  It seems to have trouble lifting bigger/taller robots. Their ramp is pretty steep. 
Qualification #15: Loss, 213 - 415, 2 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, lifted others
	Comments: Literally can’t aim. Not good
Qualification #20: Win, 300 - 246, 6 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed+lifted
	Comments: Not sure if they actually lifted the other team on them
Qualification #33: Loss, 246 - 456, 5 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: Attempted to lift others. Failed. Interesting but problematic switch system makes EZ awkward to do. 
Qualification #42: Win, 398 - 351, 5 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
Qualification #52: Win, 392 - 279, 5 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 3 Failed, platform
	Comments: Tippy; kept missing EZ
Qualification #56: Win, 371 - 255, 3 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Have ramps. Attempted to lift but couldn’t. Driving was a little slow. 
Qualification #64: Loss, 233 - 330, 0 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Has the mechanism to life others but not itself. Did not work in this match. I had trouble telling if they were playing defense or just really bad at offense ;)
Qualification #70: Win, 255 - 233, 7 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Speedy little EZ bot. Ok at switch but better at scale. 
Elimination #3: Loss, 257 - 420, 2 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, lifted others
	Comments: Very stable. Focused on its switch and ez. More awkward on ez
Elimination #7: Loss, 103 - 423, 2 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, lifted others
	Comments: A cube got stuck diagonally in its collector. Poor ez setup. Drops too high
