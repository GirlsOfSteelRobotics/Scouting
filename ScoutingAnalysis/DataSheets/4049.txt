--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #6: Loss, 72 - 355, 2 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 2 Failed, platform
	Comments: Kept missing cubes and EZ; unstable driving( bad aim) ; only mechanism is motors bringing buses into robot and pushing them into EZ
Qualification #13: Loss, 344 - 385, 6 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
Qualification #19: Loss, 269 - 401, 5 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, platform
	Comments: No collector just a hole for cubes. Very odd method of collection but it worked decently
Qualification #30: Loss, 191 - 427, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Some5ing went terribly wrong with the drive train. The robot was just spazzing and barely drove to the length of the field for the whole match. Something wrong with deposit system as well. How the numbers are makes it easy to accenedtally possess to cubes at once. 
Qualification #41: Win, 390 - 49, 5 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Not accurat no lift
Qualification #45: Loss, 271 - 360, 6 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: A little box robot that can start with a cub and can probably get cubes promo portal but it doesn’t. Good for auto if on same side and meh at EZ running.
