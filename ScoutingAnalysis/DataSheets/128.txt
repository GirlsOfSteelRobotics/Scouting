--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #10: Their driving was really jerky and slow. tried and failed to get to the platform

Qualification Match #39: had a very difficult time picking up cubes 
Qualification Match #46: VERY SLOW to bring collecter back to ground so they played defense after one cube in scale
Qualification Match #52: Had some communication errors. Attempted climb but was not successful
Qualification Match #70: A little on the slow side but overall not terrible just not that great
Qualification Match #70: Very poor collector. Struggled to get climber into the pole.
