--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #3: Loss, 278 - 375, 7 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Got stuck trying to get on platform. Reliable on EZ. Has climber mechanism but didn’t use it. 
Qualification #17: Loss, 151 - 267, 6 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: They had a rough time. Avoid if possible. Bad driving. Slow. Inefficient. It can only be an EZ runner and a climber and it doesn’t do EZ well Andy didn’t try to climb. 
Qualification #26: Loss, 288 - 364, 5 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, platform
	Comments: Attempted to be lifted
Qualification #32: Loss, 198 - 384, 4 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Not very fast at putting cubes in EZ
Qualification #44: Loss, 181 - 472, 4 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Very slow. Wire tie came off. Long breaks
Qualification #51: Win, 402 - 297, 4 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Slow to get cubes. Had collecting issues.
Qualification #60: Loss, 187 - 427, 0 EZ, 4 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: They set up their climb pretty quickly but it takes some time for it to actually move up.  They had some collector issues early on where the cube got stuck underneath the collector because they dropped a cube on itself. Once it gets the cube (which it has difficulty doing) it can put it into the switch well. 
Qualification #70: Loss, 271 - 223, 0 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: Really slow collector and lift
Qualification #74: Loss, 362 - 400, 0 EZ, 4 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Had a bit of trouble actually getting the cubes in but not a lot lot
