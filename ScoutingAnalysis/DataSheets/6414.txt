	Qualification Match #10: Ejected cube. Good that it didn’t go into the switch because it was on the wrong side.

--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #4: Win, 385 - 191, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Did not move the entire match until endgame but not enough time
Qualification #10: Loss, 185 - 438, 6 EZ, 5 Switch, 0 Scale, 3 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Rough start. Had difficulty getting cubes high enough (grabbing them low enough) to get them into the switch. Got better and is very good at running cubes into the EZ. Their bumper fabric did come loose Android start peeling back/dragging though. 
Qualification #24: Loss, 285 - 447, 3 EZ, 4 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Looked a little confused 
Qualification #28: Loss, 224 - 461, 5 EZ, 5 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Really good driving prevention opposite alliance robot from getting access to cubes and running them back and forth from EZ and switch
Qualification #36: Win, 301 - 280, 2 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 2 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Not fast. Collector had trouble gathering cubes at times. Played defense to compensate for failing collector.
Qualification #51: Loss, 297 - 402, 9 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Fast EZ
Qualification #59: Loss, 199 - 348, 8 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: They seemed to be less coordinated than yesterday. Took them multiples tries to angle robot correctly and collect from the correct angle and quickly. Still moves and corrects quickly though. Distracted from EZ by opposing defense switch. 
Qualification #63: Win, 491 - 184, 3 EZ, 5 Switch, 0 Scale, 2 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Scattered around the field- didn’t focus on maintaining a specific switch or scale which may have harmed them. Didn’t look like their best match
Qualification #75: Loss, 117 - 334, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Broke down half way through
