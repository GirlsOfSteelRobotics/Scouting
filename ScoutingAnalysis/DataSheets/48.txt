--------------- General Comments ---------------
Match #8: Other robots in alliance were not playing and committing fouls. Big robot with ramps that I’m guessing can lift two other bots to climb
Match #13: Just sat there
Match #22: Can lift two other bots for climbing. Lifted one this time. Seems like lift/collect broke halfway through match. 
Match #31: Seemed like their robot had more capabilities than just EZ but strategically they decided to only focus on that aspect. 
Match #42: Had a hard time gripping the cubes. 
Match #52: Not moving 30 seconds after end of autonomous. Another robot in alliance also stopped moving
Match #63: Poor driving ability. They kept dropping cubes and struggled a lot to do anything the whole match. They fell off of their partner’s climbing ramp.
