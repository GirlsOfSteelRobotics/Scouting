--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #8: Other robots in alliance were not playing and committing fouls. Big robot with ramps that I’m guessing can lift two other bots to climb
Qualification Match #13: Just sat there
Qualification Match #22: Can lift two other bots for climbing. Lifted one this time. Seems like lift/collect broke halfway through match. 
Qualification Match #31: Seemed like their robot had more capabilities than just EZ but strategically they decided to only focus on that aspect. 
Qualification Match #42: Had a hard time gripping the cubes. 
Qualification Match #52: Not moving 30 seconds after end of autonomous. Another robot in alliance also stopped moving
Qualification Match #63: Poor driving ability. They kept dropping cubes and struggled a lot to do anything the whole match. They fell off of their partner’s climbing ramp.
Qualification Match #74: Didn’t do anything
Qualification Match #87: Dropped some cubes. Received really aggressive defense but handled it well. 
Qualification Match #92: Missed scale many times
