Qualification #19: Loss, 269 - 401, 0 EZ, 4 Switch, 1 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed

	Comments: Yellow card
Qualification #53: Loss, 220 - 411, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Shooter bot. Seemed to be having problems with intake. Kept picking up cubes and spitting them out for most of the match. Broke a plate off the scale somehow...
