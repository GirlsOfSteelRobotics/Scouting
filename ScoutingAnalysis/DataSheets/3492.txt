--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #2: Win, 423 - 100, 9 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: Really fast EZ bot. Got all 9 cubes with 60 seconds in auto left but then didn’t do too much. Took a lot of time to set up an unsuccessful climb. They had issues with their collector getting the way and couldn’t say up after the robot was disabled. One robot from the opposite alliance was missing.
Qualification #10: Win, 438 - 185, 9 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Could not grasp cubes at beginning but really got crap together at end and got 9 cubes in EZ
Qualification #18: Loss, 199 - 373, 5 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
Qualification #32: Loss, 198 - 384, 2 EZ, 4 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: They had a failed scale at the beginning. It seemed like their lift broke halfway through. It couldn’t go all the way up anymore. Also they have trouble collecting. When they try to collect and it is unsuccessful the cube goes out 4 feet. 
Qualification #41: Win, 390 - 49, 4 EZ, 0 Switch, 1 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Collector wheels moved too fast so it kicked cubes a lot. Hella tippy. ALMOST fell over
Qualification #48: Win, 442 - 107, 0 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, attempted climb
Qualification #58: Win, 452 - 275, 9 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 2 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Fast EZ bot but kept missing cubes to the switch.
Qualification #62: Win, 433 - 269, 5 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Did EZ for a bit then drove around and played defense. Not entirely sure why. 
Qualification #72: Win, 334 - 330, 5 EZ, 2 Switch, 1 Scale, 1 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Wrist/collector got hella twisted at the end. Couldn’t lift anymore after that.
