--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #12: Knocked 2 cubes off of the scale when placing cubes. 
Qualification Match #37: Difficulty picking up from ground. Slid off another robot’s platform when climbing
Qualification Match #45: Missed a couple of times on scale
Qualification Match #53: Very efficient placement. No dropping of the cube. 
Qualification Match #69: Struggled to pick up cubes. Couldn’t get on platform because it has Omni wheels. It looks incapable of putting cubes in the EZ but that is just speculation. 
Qualification Match #81: Very good arm and collector mechanism 
Elimination Match #2: Dropped cubes from portal on the floor to collect cubes
Elimination Match #6: Never touches opposing switch
