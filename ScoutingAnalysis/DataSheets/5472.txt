All auto comments:
	Qualification Match #20: Tried to do 2
	Qualification Match #39: Messed up auto. It looked first to the scale but it was the wrong color. Then it turned to the switch but it was also the wrong color so it drove parallel to the switch pushing all of the clothesline cubes and getting a penalty. Then it dropped its cube. I don’t know what was up with that. 
	Qualification Match #77: attempted double switch
	Elimination Match #2: Tried putting in opposite scale
	Elimination Match #6: Missed scale
	Elimination Match #13: Attempted switch but failed

--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #8: Loss, 244 - 410, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 7 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Very tippy; good aim 
Qualification #14: Win, 370 - 274, 3 EZ, 0 Switch, 4 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Attempted to climb on the platform of another robot
Qualification #20: Win, 300 - 246, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 4 Scale, 3 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Tried to drive with lift up and was very tippy. It has potential to be a good scale robot bc physical mechanisms are good and smooth but drivers weren’t
Qualification #33: Win, 456 - 246, 0 EZ, 3 Switch, 3 Scale, 1 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Ran out of time to get onto platform. If the scale was at its max height and the cube slipped a little bit while it was being raised up the lift would not be tall enough to put cubes onto the scale anymore. They do place cubes really carefully onto the scale though. 
Qualification #39: Win, 395 - 215, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 6 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Good robot. Helped out a stuck teammate
Qualification #44: Win, 472 - 181, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 3 Scale, 1 Failed, platform
	Comments: Very flexible. Did what was needed.

Qualification #62: Loss, 269 - 433, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 3 Scale, 2 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Scale pretty stuffed and couldn’t fit another on there
