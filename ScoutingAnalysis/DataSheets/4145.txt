--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #4: Win, 385 - 191, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 4 Scale, 3 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Has arm for other robots to climb onto. Drops cube a lot and does not have very good aim when going for scale.
Qualification #11: Win, 392 - 187, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 6 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Very good scale robot. Slower but very reliable and places it carefully. They do like to drive while they are raising the lift so could be tippy but seemed fine during this match. They have a helper bar on the climb but it takes a while to set it up. So good robot but don’t really want them to climb. 
Qualification #19: Win, 401 - 269, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 2 Scale, 1 Failed, platform
	Comments: Have ability to climb but climbing arm would not work
Qualification #27: Win, 397 - 172, 0 EZ, 3 Switch, 2 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Had extension arm to create more climbing room for robots but didn’t lift anyone
Qualification #37: Win, 335 - 251, 0 EZ, 4 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Got blocked 
Qualification #49: Loss, 288 - 338, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 5 Scale, 2 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Knocked one of the five cubes off the scale. Kind of tippy 
Qualification #58: Win, 452 - 275, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 5 Scale, 2 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Kept dropping cubes. Drivers couldn’t see? Pretty fast though
Qualification #62: Loss, 269 - 433, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 4 Scale, 2 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Drops the cubes a lot. Tried to get onto platform but failed. 
Qualification #70: Win, 255 - 233, 0 EZ, 5 Switch, 0 Scale, 3 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: Couldn’t get bar and helper up on time. Their collector is iffy. Could’ve done more but didn’t seem to know what to do in the first couple of seconds. 
Elimination #2: Loss, 340 - 382, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 5 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Takes a while to climb; difficulty collecting cubes (claw weak)

Elimination #13: Win, 345 - 213, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 3 Scale, 4 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: Needed a bot to push it up platform; didn’t have enough time to pull itself up; kept missing scale
