--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #1: Loss, 127 - 402, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Tried to grab a cube. Didn’t grab a single cube. Tried to block other robots maybe.
Qualification #12: Loss, 71 - 381, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Their collector did not have wheels so they had a hard time being a bulky robot and not being able to manuver around the cube stack.  They almost fell over. Also this alliance was missing a robot. 
Qualification #22: Win, 320 - 162, 2 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Slow like turtle. Couldn’t really pick cubes up but push them
Qualification #31: Win, 324 - 170, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Very tippy
Qualification #43: Win, 397 - 292, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Tipped over at beginning of match.
Qualification #51: Win, 402 - 297, 0 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Bad
Qualification #58: Loss, 275 - 452, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Their collector doesn’t work so all they can do is push cubes around for its alliance partners. It kind of got in the way and should have been playing defense. 
Qualification #69: Loss, 261 - 369, 1 EZ, 0 Switch, 1 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Really bad collector
Qualification #77: Win, 371 - 222, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
