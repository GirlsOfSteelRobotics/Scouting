--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #8: Had a hard time getting cubes from the floor and couldn’t lift cubes 
Qualification Match #17: Collector was very ineffective...they tried pushing blocks to help their alliance
Qualification Match #23: Very slow. Mostly pushed cubes around
Qualification Match #40: Could Not pick up cubes at all...tried the whole match to pick up a cube and failed
Qualification Match #50: Not good
Qualification Match #68: Just had two flimsy arms off the front which didn’t really hold cubes but could kind of push them
Qualification Match #75: Worst collector I’ve seen yet. Can push around cubes if it doesn’t try to pick them up. Can only feasibly do the EZ. 
Qualification Match #85: Robot could not pick up cubes and did nothing
