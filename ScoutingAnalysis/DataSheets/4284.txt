--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #9: Very slow...got stuck on scale for 30 sec...struggled to put cube in scale
Qualification Match #14: Something went wrong with the pistons on the lift so it stopped working half way through. Collector was very inefficient. The drive team wore kilts though. Only people with extreme self confidence will wear kilts. Good for them. 
Qualification Match #35: Has trouble picking cubes off ground and keeping them when lifting up to scale. 
Qualification Match #42: Often struggled to pick up cubes and struggled to get onto the platform to climb
Qualification Match #60: This robot broke right after autonomous 
Qualification Match #90: Got penalty. Clippers are bad so hard go grab boxes
