--------------- General Comments ---------------
Match #5: Mecanum drive. It goes fast but they had some trouble moving during the match.
Match #14: Put cubes in other teams switch to stop them from scoring
Match #23: Very very efficient at receiving cubes from portal and placing in switch and scale 
Match #34: They are very good at placing cubes in the defensive switch because they are fast on cycle time between portal station and switch.
Match #51: Slow climb...almost tipped while climbing...doesnâ€™t seem reliable for climbing
Match #59: GOod for getting cubes from portal to opponent switch. Climbs quickly
