--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #5: Mecanum drive. It goes fast but they had some trouble moving during the match.
Qualification Match #14: Put cubes in other teams switch to stop them from scoring
Qualification Match #23: Very very efficient at receiving cubes from portal and placing in switch and scale 
Qualification Match #34: They are very good at placing cubes in the defensive switch because they are fast on cycle time between portal station and switch.
Qualification Match #51: Slow climb...almost tipped while climbing...doesnâ€™t seem reliable for climbing
Qualification Match #59: GOod for getting cubes from portal to opponent switch. Climbs quickly
Qualification Match #70: Terrible at collecting. Flimsy looking mechanisms. Only succeeded at the EZ. 
Qualification Match #81: Fast but driving was not good
Qualification Match #86: Defense can knock the cube off of the robot easily. The cubes are not secured.
