--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #5: Was heavily defended against and robot got caught in it

Qualification Match #47: Heavily defended
Qualification Match #67: very good maneuvering and good at taking cubes to needed areas
Qualification Match #72: Could have gotten more but another robot was helping them with the ez and they were getting in each other’s way
Qualification Match #85: Good design but pretty poor driving. Cubes sometimes fall from the collector.
