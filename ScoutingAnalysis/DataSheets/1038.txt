--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #7: In scale battle against one robot from the red alliance.  Only misplaced 1 cube on scale
Qualification Match #13: Missed the scale a few times
Qualification Match #23: Struggling to eject cubes far enough away from bot to get it onto scale. Had difficulty picking up cubes.
Qualification Match #37: Did not have enough time to climb but wasn’t clear that they would have made it. Lift not tall enough to reach over scale when tipped up
Qualification Match #61: Collector kept getting stuck in tilted position so they could not collect cubes...ver slow to hook on to climbing bar
Qualification Match #66: Really accurate with EZ; it climbed but the rope they climbed with broke so they prob can’t climb anymore
Qualification Match #72: Super tippy. Can’t reach top of scale when scale is at tallest height. 
Qualification Match #89: Tried to climb up on the other robot but failed
