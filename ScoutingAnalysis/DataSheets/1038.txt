Match #7: In scale battle against one robot from the red alliance.  Only misplaced 1 cube on scale
Match #13: Missed the scale a few times
Match #23: Struggling to eject cubes far enough away from bot to get it onto scale. Had difficulty picking up cubes.
Match #37: Did not have enough time to climb but wasnâ€™t clear that they would have made it. Lift not tall enough to reach over scale when tipped up
Match #61: Collector kept getting stuck in tilted position so they could not collect cubes...ver slow to hook on to climbing bar
