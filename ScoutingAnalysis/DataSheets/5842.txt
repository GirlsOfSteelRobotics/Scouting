--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #8: Loss, 410 - 244, 0 EZ, 2 Switch, 3 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Better off for collecting when cube is dropped from portal and onto floor. Awarded climb bc they were being blocked by the other team.
Qualification #17: Loss, 151 - 267, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 5 Scale, 1 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: Very aggressive throws for the scale that causes drops. Very tippy. Climbed but then fell. Collectors were glitchy so we had to slam into a wall. 
Qualification #23: Loss, 269 - 329, 0 EZ, 2 Switch, 4 Scale, 0 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: Climbed but then fell down when robot was disabled. Idk if this counts. Robot is fast and stable. It did get caught on the scale and got a penalty but it corrected itself. 
Qualification #34: Win, 299 - 257, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 3 Scale, 2 Failed, platform
	Comments: Sturdy little robot. Hardly tippy at all. 
Qualification #43: Win, 397 - 292, 0 EZ, 2 Switch, 5 Scale, 1 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: Pretty tippy. Go less accurate as the match went on 
Qualification #47: Loss, 254 - 263, 4 EZ, 0 Switch, 1 Scale, 1 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Tippy. Robot stopped working towards the end. 
Qualification #61: Win, 426 - 201, 2 EZ, 4 Switch, 2 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Very fast and versatile; fell down on climb but didn’t touch platform
Qualification #66: Win, 338 - 285, 2 EZ, 2 Switch, 2 Scale, 2 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Their collector has these floppy wheels on it so it needs to push a cube against a wall in order to collect it. It makes the robot cycle time very slow. 
Qualification #76: Win, 343 - 303, 1 EZ, 3 Switch, 2 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Very flexible robot
Elimination #1: Win, 299 - 136, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 4 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
Elimination #5: Win, 316 - 250, 0 EZ, 2 Switch, 3 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Good at scale
Elimination #11: Loss, 223 - 358, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 4 Scale, 2 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: Didn’t have time to complete climb
Elimination #13: Loss, 213 - 345, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 4 Scale, 2 Failed, no endgame
