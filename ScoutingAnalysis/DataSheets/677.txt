Qualification Match #17: robot drove around well but didn’t perform tasks
Qualification Match #22: had a few failed switch attempts
Qualification Match #33: Missed multiple times on the scale. Had a hard time lining up the cube with the EZ. 
Qualification Match #43: Very good at EZ. 
Qualification Match #55: Didn’t quite get on platform. It had to turn 180 degrees to get the cube into EZ. Has gloves on the collector then uses back end of robot to push into ez.

Elimination Match #8: Very reliable with the EZ
