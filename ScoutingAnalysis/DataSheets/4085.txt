--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #40: Really hard time picking up. Very wobbly. 
Qualification Match #55: Slightly struggled to get cubes...missed switch couple of times ....stopped working in endgame
Qualification Match #66: Struggled to pick up cube and also struggled to put cubes in ez
Qualification Match #79: Very hard time collecting cubes. 
Elimination Match #3: Was on the slower side and didnâ€™t look like they had a plan.  Like they would start to go one place and just change their mind and went somewhere else
Elimination Match #7: Stopped at end like they lost contact.  Again a wanderer by they had no specific purpose
