Match #16: Seemed to have a broken collector and lift. Tried to climb but were too late and wobbled a lot

Match #29: Did not do anything. I think mechanisms were broken. Drove around to get in peopleâ€™s way But fell over at the end as it was going onto the platform. 
Match #49: Very slow. Was lifted by another team. 
Match #60: Tippy. Failed to do anything with cubes even though it tried. Then played defense but not well. Mostly buzzed around aimlessly. Then tipped over right before the end of the match.
