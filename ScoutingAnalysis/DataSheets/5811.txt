--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #13: Fast robot but not very accurate (driving)
Qualification Match #40: Kept missing switch and had to keep getting new cubes from portal
Qualification Match #48: did well on taking cubes from portal to switch 
Qualification Match #80: Multiple failed switch attempts 
Qualification Match #90: Tended to shoot cubes to the far back of the scale which made it harder for the switch to tip
Elimination Match #3: Silly mistake of trying to stack cubes on switch before there was a base layer. They should fill out the base layer first so the cubes donâ€™t fall off too much. 
Elimination Match #7: lost communication never moved
Elimination Match #10: Damn good job. Very efficient 
Elimination Match #13: Had some proboes collecting. More defense would be good.
