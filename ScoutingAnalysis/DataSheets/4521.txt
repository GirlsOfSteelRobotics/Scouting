Qualification #59: Win, 348 - 199, 1 EZ, 0 Switch, 4 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Could have put more cubes in scale but the other alliance was not putting any in theirs so they stopped....could have lifted two other robots but they struggled to get on so they climbed by themselves
Qualification #63: Win, 330 - 233, 2 EZ, 2 Switch, 2 Scale, 1 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Other robot was blocking it from climbing. Cubes slipped from mechanism a lot
Qualification #71: Loss, 124 - 399, 1 EZ, 8 Switch, 1 Scale, 0 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: They were fairly stable with really fast cycle time for the switch but less fast for the scale and for the exchange. Their climber looked shaken. 
Elimination #3: Loss, 257 - 420, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 3 Scale, 1 Failed, lifted others
	Comments: Ok at scale....ran out of cubes on field so there was nothing for it to do
