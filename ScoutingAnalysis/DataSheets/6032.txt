--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #8: Loss, 244 - 410, 7 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Very fast at getting the EZ. Almost overshot the switch catapult and did overshoot the next tried. Tried to compensate with driving but I think it would be a really good cube runner. Small robot. Short and compact. Speed slowed at end because there was bot from other alliance playing defense. This alliance given a climb because of contact penalty by other alliance in last 30 seconds
Qualification #12: Win, 381 - 71, 4 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: No lift. Small Not that good
Qualification #26: Win, 328 - 227, 9 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Not as fast as the morning but it was more crowded and less cubes available. Really good EZ runner
Qualification #35: Loss, 236 - 222, 8 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Very quick grabbing and EZ. 
Qualification #42: Loss, 351 - 381, 9 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, platform
	Comments: Very good at EZ. Not great at switch. Unable to do scale
Qualification #46: Win, 390 - 118, 7 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Very good at EZ. Got stuck at the EZ for a bit but was able to wiggle itself lose. 
Qualification #54: Loss, 89 - 373, 2 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: No lift
Qualification #64: Loss, 233 - 330, 8 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Tried to be lifted but failed; difficulty holding cubes 
Qualification #73: Win, 400 - 362, 0 EZ, 4 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: Slow robot. Couldn’t do much 
Elimination #3: Win, 420 - 257, 5 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: They can’t scale. They also are only good at the cubes set up on ground on their side. If the cubes are messed up they can’t really do much. 
Elimination #7: Win, 423 - 103, 2 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, no endgame
	Comments: They didn’t contribute much. The reason the alliance won is the scale went uncontested. 
Elimination #12: Win, 370 - 291, 4 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 2 Failed, platform
Elimination #14: Loss, 300 - 442, 6 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 2 Failed, platform
