--------------- Match Data -----------------------
Qualification #2: Loss, 100 - 423, 2 EZ, 2 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Collector arm broke mid match so they began to play defense and push bot into EZ
Qualification #16: Loss, 231 - 413, 0 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 2 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Had a really hard time getting cubes off the ground and into the switch. The drivers didn’t seem too at ease. They have Gears from last year’s game as collectors and a spring connecting them together. Sometimes the cube would get behind the spring and they’d be stuck. Climb took around 20 seconds to set up and do. 
Qualification #25: Loss, 227 - 328, 0 EZ, 0 Switch, 1 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Robot was dumb. Their strategy was poor considering they had two robot shots on their alliance which could’ve lifted other robots but no they had to climb just themselves to get all the credit and the other robots were unable to climb. Other than that they weren’t pretty goof
Qualification #34: Loss, 257 - 299, 1 EZ, 1 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Can’t actually lift the cube off the ground
Qualification #40: Win, 431 - 260, 3 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Omni wheels so very rolly but didn’t use then effectively. Mediocre collector
Qualification #44: Loss, 181 - 472, 0 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, attempted climb
	Comments: Collector wasn’t very fast. It wasn’t very good
Qualification #53: Loss, 220 - 411, 2 EZ, 0 Switch, 0 Scale, 1 Failed, attempted climb
Qualification #70: Loss, 233 - 255, 1 EZ, 4 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, platform
	Comments: Ability to climb but other robot on alliance climbed instead
Qualification #75: Win, 334 - 117, 1 EZ, 3 Switch, 0 Scale, 0 Failed, climbed
	Comments: Pretty fast and efficient
