--------------- General Comments ---------------
Match #16: had multiple failed attempts at scale
Match #30: Dropped one cube. Very good at putting on the scale. A little wobbly seemed like it could fall. 
Match #35: The robot broke down during the entire teleop period and came back to life around 19 sec left.
Match #45: Didnâ€™t do very much and was borderline defensive
