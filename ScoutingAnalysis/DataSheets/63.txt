--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #5: Slow. Collector was wimpy. Wasn’t tall enough to reach scale but tried anyway.

Qualification Match #21: bad at picking up cubes
Qualification Match #33: Was very slow at first and missed the scale a few times 
Qualification Match #64: Very good at EZ. Might have gotten stuck in EZ? Got unstuck at the end though. 
Qualification Match #76: Good at scale. Climbed with one other robot.
Qualification Match #85: Can climb in the side of the scale so another robot can climb too
