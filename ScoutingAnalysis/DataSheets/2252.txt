--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #2: attempted switch multiple times but was unsuccessful
Qualification Match #14: I think lift/collector broke halfway through. Used robot chassis to nudge cubes into EZ. Attempted to climb and lift another robot with it but it was misaligned and did not have enough time to adjust. 
Qualification Match #36: Has ability to climb and lift two other robots but ran out of time. Slow driving
Qualification Match #48: Slow to climb. Went to climb before climbing was allowed (gave up a little bit)
Qualification Match #53: it was ok
Qualification Match #68: Bad collector. Ok robot. 
Qualification Match #74: Not very tippy for their height
