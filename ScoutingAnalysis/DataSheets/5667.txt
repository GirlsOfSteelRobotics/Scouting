--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #8: The robot did not move for the entire match. 
Qualification Match #21: Tried to get on the platform. Extremely slow to place lifted cubes into the scale. 
Qualification Match #36: Struggled to pick up cube. Broke a piece of the field. 
Qualification Match #44: Was not moving for a while and was in the way. Very little contribution to alliance
Qualification Match #59: Fell backwards omto switch while climbing
Qualification Match #67: Was kind of awkward and seemed to have issues in the middle and just stopped moving for ten seconds
Qualification Match #78: Put cube in WRONG SIDE OF SWITCH in auto. Bad collector. Only placed one cube the whole match. 
Qualification Match #84: Did not move. Looked like it was supposed to be offense but didnâ€™t connect
