--------------- General Comments ---------------
Qualification Match #10: I think their lift broke at the beginning of the match. Played defense for the rest but didn’t really do much
Qualification Match #15: Close to getting a cube on the scale
Qualification Match #28: Has an extra bar for other robots to come. 
Qualification Match #34: Have an extended bar to assist another team climb but wasn’t used in this match
Qualification Match #49: arm is well maneuvered
Qualification Match #59: Very tippy putting it in scale. Spazzing wrist. Penalty for wrong switch zone.
Qualification Match #68: pretty quick and good at moving around
Qualification Match #92: Clamp collector worked best when cubes were on other cubes or not on the floor. Might have been an attempted climb but didn’t get far.
